# Ecobici_DataVisualization
Jupyter notebooks from the competition of data visualization for CIMAT
Recommendations the dataset are from ECOBICI cdmx, so there is easy to download because are heavy files, secondly for some reason Github does not show the graphics, so if you want to see them , please go to https://plot.ly/~PrideJC#/
